Current Plan:
- Work on timer operations:
  - Setting timers & keeping them persistent btwn tabs
  - When I close all tabs, stop the timer & save its state

- Change Current Session page to sidebar



State Flow: (multiple start state options)
Landing -> Start Session -> Settings for Session -> Current Session 
Landing -> Manage Blacklist -> Landing
Landing -> Forest -> View Trees
Current Session -> Session Ended -> Landing
Session Ended -> Landing




Feature Decisions/ Questions
  How should blacklist be changed?
  -MVP: One blacklist and it can be managed via landing page
  -Future: Multiple blacklists, under different labels. Choose btwn when starting session. 
    - Manage blacklists via landing page


  How Should Tree Generation Operate?
  - How do I ensure differing trees? / How many choice options generate different enough fractal trees?
    - Will randomizing btwn these choices work?
  - Current Plan: 
    - Depending on the length of the focus session chosen the final tree will be more or less complex ( more complex for longer focus)
    - Tree graphics are generated slowly to encompass full time of timer
      - When a session is stopped, either manually or due to browser being closed/ blacklist site being visited, save static version of created graphic
          - Give user option to put it in their library
      - When Pause is implemented: Session should be saved in a way we can continue tree generation

  Fixed Time Options for Sessions or Manual Entry of Any Time?
  - MVP: Depends on how tree generation goes
    - Ideally a more complex tree will be generated from a longer focus session
    - Maybe the variables to create the tree could be partially seeded based on time of session?
      - Need to verify there are options to have same time length while not generating too similar of a tree

  Should it prevent someone from going to blacklisted pages or just warn them session will be ended?
  - MVP: warn them
  - Future Version: 
    - Allow user to decide what it should do when starting the session


  What if someone was in an active session and then closed the browser?
  - don't want them to lose the progress they made 
  - Min Viable Product: 
    - session should be stopped and saved
    - when they reopen browser, if they click on the extension, 
      it should show a page asking them if they want to save the tree from the session
  - Future Version:
    - When pause is implemented:
      - Closing browser in session should pause the session vs stop, allowing them to continue the session

Later Features
  Pausing:
  - pause should save time left and a static version of what was generated on the canvas to local storage and variables which generated tree
    - on unpause, should go through graphic generation up to current state in static version then "grow" slowly during rest of timer length
      - need to determine way to save spot where graphics generation paused - in the code

  Minimizing Sidebar during active session 
  - If I'm focusing, I might not want smthn taking up screen space
  - Best way to notify of something when minimized?
    - if the session ends or someone is navigating 

  Multiple Blacklist lists

  Statistics of focus Sessions
  - how long total, when do you focus, which sites most commonly break your focus, etc
