Page Flow and Design Decisions:

State Flow: (multiple start state options)
Landing -> Start Session -> Settings for Session -> Current Session 
Landing -> Manage Blacklist -> Landing
Landing -> Forest -> View Trees
Current Session -> Session Ended -> Landing
Session Ended -> Landing


 How to implement saving of time?
  - background script
    - when window opened, add window to windows array
    - 
  - Landing.tsx
    - when session is started:
        - save state: InSession 
            - this will cause App.tsx to render inSession view
        - save timer length in local storage
  - InSession.tsx
      - start timer -> create var time remaining -> counting down to 0
      options:
        - user doesnt access banned sites or close browser b4 timer finishes : time remaining at 0
            - move to Session Complete page
                - ask user if we want to save tree:
                    - y: 
                        - save timer data in user info in database (for stats)
                    - clear timer data from local storage
                    - go back to landing
        - user accesses banned site // Later want to make this so user is warned first when url access attempted
            - timer stopped
            - move to Session Complete Page
        - MPV: user closes browser 
    
        - Future: user closes browser
            - remaining time stored in local storage
        - when we reopen browser:
            - browser checks if we have item saved in timer
              - if so, change state to Session Complete Page




Feature Decisions/ Questions
  How should blacklist be changed?
  -MVP: One blacklist and it can be managed via landing page
  -Future: Multiple blacklists, under different labels. Choose btwn when starting session. 
    - Manage blacklists via landing page


  How Should Tree Generation Operate?
  - How do I ensure differing trees? / How many choice options generate different enough fractal trees?
    - Will randomizing btwn these choices work?
  - Current Plan: 
    - Depending on the length of the focus session chosen the final tree will be more or less complex ( more complex for longer focus)
    - Tree graphics are generated slowly to encompass full time of timer
      - When a session is stopped, either manually or due to browser being closed/ blacklist site being visited, save static version of created graphic
          - Give user option to put it in their library
      - When Pause is implemented: Session should be saved in a way we can continue tree generation

  Fixed Time Options for Sessions or Manual Entry of Any Time?
  - MVP: Depends on how tree generation goes
    - Ideally a more complex tree will be generated from a longer focus session
    - Maybe the variables to create the tree could be partially seeded based on time of session?
      - Need to verify there are options to have same time length while not generating too similar of a tree

  Should it prevent someone from going to blacklisted pages or just warn them session will be ended?
  - MVP: warn them
  - Future Version: 
    - Allow user to decide what it should do when starting the session


  What if someone was in an active session and then closed the browser?
  - don't want them to lose the progress they made 
  - Min Viable Product: 
    - session should be stopped and saved
    - when they reopen browser, if they click on the extension, 
      it should show a page asking them if they want to save the tree from the session
  - Future Version:
    - When pause is implemented:
      - Closing browser in session should pause the session vs stop, allowing them to continue the session


Later Features
  Pausing:
  - pause should save time left and a static version of what was generated on the canvas to local storage and variables which generated tree
    - on unpause, should go through graphic generation up to current state in static version then "grow" slowly during rest of timer length
      - need to determine way to save spot where graphics generation paused - in the code

  Minimizing Sidebar during active session 
  - If I'm focusing, I might not want smthn taking up screen space
  - Best way to notify of something when minimized?
    - if the session ends or someone is navigating 

  Multiple Blacklist lists

  Statistics of focus Sessions
  - how long total, when do you focus, which sites most commonly break your focus, etc
