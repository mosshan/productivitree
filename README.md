# Productivitree ðŸŒ³

Boost your productivity and cultivate focus with Productivitree, a browser extension designed to help you stay on track during your study sessions. Simply set a session length and list of banned sites, and as you concentrate, watch a unique fractal tree flourish in your sidebar. But beware! If you stray to a restricted site, your tree's growth comes to a halt.

## Features:

- **Fractal Trees for Focus:**
  Watch a fractal tree sprout up while you're deep into your study session! 

- **Customizable Study Sessions:**
  Set the duration of your study session and curate a list of banned sites to tailor your focus experience.

- **Accountability with Trees:**
  Collect your grown trees and track your progress, turning productivity into a tangible and rewarding journey.

## Project Status:

Productivitree is currently in its early stages, initially being implemented for Firefox with plans to become cross-browser compatible. Your feedback and contributions are welcomed :)

## In Memory:

This project holds a special place in my heart as it is dedicated to a friend who passed away. The idea sprouted during a Hackathon, a collaborative effort that unfortunately didn't materialize in their lifetime. Productivitree is a tribute to their memory and a commitment to bringing their vision to life.

Feel free to branch out, contribute, and cultivate focus with Productivitree. Let's grow together! ðŸš€
